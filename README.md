#Development Methodology :
#Scrum Methodology
Scrum is an Agile development methodology used in the development of software based on an iterative and incremental processes. Each iteration consists of two to four week sprints, where each sprintâ€™s goal is to build the most important features first and come out with a potentially deliverable product.

#Sprint Map
Below points provides insight to sprint wise progress:

#Week 1 :
1 Learn more about Backend in Web-development.
2 Decide tech stack and architecture.
3 Learn Django for server-side rendering.
4 Learn about Git and GitHub.

#Week 2 :
1 Work on the User Interface.
2 Complete Sign-in and Sign-up and main page of website.
3 Learn more about Django for server-side rendering.
4 Research about other features.
5 Tried to implement a student-teacher model for the website.

#Week 3 :
1 Improve the User Interface.
2 Kept on trying to implement the student-teacher model
3 Came across many bugs while implementing ,so then due to approaching deadline started implementing  basic functionality first.




#Week 4 :
1 Add basic functionality i.e. attendance tracking via face recognition.
2 Update README.
3 Create demo video.
